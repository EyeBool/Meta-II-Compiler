# Meta-II-Compiler

A [Meta II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/META_II) to VALGOL compiler based on Schorre's famous paper "A Syntax-Oriented Compiler Writing Language". The compiler is written in C++11, and uses a recursive descent parser.

## Structure

* `IOUtilities`: An C++11 library to manage input/output for the compiler. Reads from `stdin`, outputs VALGOL code to `stdout`, and errors to `stderr`. Needs to be initialized by calling `initialize()` to started reading from `stdin`.
* `MetaII`: A C++11 library to compile Meta II to VALGOL. Uses `IOUtitlies` for input/output. Has a single function `compile()` that calls `initialize()` from `IOUtilities`, and then proceeds to parse Meta II equations from `stdin`, and input the corresponding VALGOL instructions to `stdout`.

## Getting Structured

Include the `IOUtilities` and `MetaII` libraries in your source file, and call `compile()`. The compiler will take over and do its thing.
